This directory contains all the software that will run in production.
Both the deployment scripts and the development environment depend on this.
The integration tests also make use of the code in this directory.

In the lib subdirectory you will find the library code for the software.
In the www subdirectory you will find the web pages for the software.
In the etc subdirectory you will find configuration files
for the web server (Nginx) and for the application server (PHP-FPM).
The Nix derivation generates wrappers for nginx and php-fpm.
These wrappers pass the correct configuration file paths.

The file etc/nginx.conf.php defines the routes for the application.
All requests are subsequently handled by www/index.php.
The routes pass it the mainClass argument, and the arguments argument.
These arguments are used to select a main class and call its main method.
