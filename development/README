This directory contains scripts for starting the development environment.
The development environment is managed by Hivemind [1].

The Nix derivation generates a Procfile file and wrapper for hivemind.
This wrapper starts Hivemind with the generated Procfile file.
Hivemind will run in the working directory of the caller.
